# CTU-CPP
The project aims to create a C++ version of CTU-Core, a Java-based client-server application. Its primary goal is to facilitate efficient communication between clients and servers, utilizing advanced encryption and compression methods, among other features. The end result will be a user-friendly and streamlined package.

Most of the project will exist under Security.h, Test.cpp, and CtuNet.h until the major functionalities are completed.
