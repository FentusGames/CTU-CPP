# CTU-CPP
This project involves creating a C++ version of CTU-Core, which is currently a Java-based client-server application. The main objective of the project is to ensure effective communication between clients and servers by incorporating advanced encryption and compression methods. The ultimate goal is to provide a user-friendly and streamlined package. For now, the bulk of the project will be contained within Security.h, Test.cpp, and CtuNet.h until the major functionalities are fully developed.
